**Shopify 2022 Summer Frontend Intern Challenge**
=================================================

Hello! This is an Instagram Clone project designed to display the NASA APOD with Like/Unlike functionality that I made as part 

of my application for this summer's Frontend Engineer Shopify internship.

**How to Use**
--------------

* Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/yasssami/frontendchallenge_2022.git`
* Switch your directory to that of the project's: `cd frontendchallenge_2022`
* Run `npm start` (You may set up a `.env` file if my API key is out of requests)

**Technologies and Breakdown**
------------------------------

This project was built using JavaScript, CSS and React *(Material-UI, create-react-app)* and performs the following:

* Random APOD entries from the NASA archive.
* Instagram-like layout with posts containing the APOD image, date, as well as description.
* Heart-shaped, animated button able to perform Like/Unlike actions.
* Styled font & app icon.
